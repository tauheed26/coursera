###Instructions for creating a tidy dataset from the accelerometer data for further analysis:


1. Download the accelerometer data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip into the working directory. The top level data folder "UCI HAR Dataset" should be in the working directory. 


2. Place the script "run_analysis.R" in the working directory and run it.


3. This will result in the tidy text file = "tidy\_activity\_subject_means.txt", which contains the averages of the mean and the standard deviation per unique (activity, subject) pair


###NOTE:

See **CodeBook.md** for description of the extraction process and the columns in the file.
